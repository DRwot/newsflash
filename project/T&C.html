    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    
    <div class="terms"><p>
        <br>I do release these Website so that you "the End-user" can benefit from it in terms of using Website or any other of these releases without buying the required licenses. Newsflash, however, believes that everyone should have the option to access News and be able to read it without any problems.

<br>Further, I do NOT in any way condone the spreading of this program, in other words I do NOT spread the releases to any websites, P2P networks or any other public available location. I urge that this releases should not be spread like that at all.

<br>I Newsflash has nothing to do with the distribution of these program, it is all done by third parties. As such, and according to the laws where the individuals of i reside, it is not my responsibility what others decides to do with these releases. However, let it be said quite clearly:

<br> "I DO NOT in any way condone the selling or redistribution of these program, this was NEVER my intention."

<br>Newsflash does NOT take any responsibility of computer-loss or any data-errors that may occur from using these program. Keep in mind that you are using a third party solution to something we did not develop in the first place.

<br>Do note that the usage of these program are legal in most countries outside the United States, IF and ONLY IF you own a full copy of the program - then you may use these program for backup purposes, and only that. It remains to be seen how affected you are of the End User License Agreements (EULAs). They can't supersede domestic laws, remember that.

<br>According to the "DMCA ACT" in the Unites States, you have no rights to circumvent a copy protection. Beware, they will punish you harder than if you stole the shrinkwrapped Website in a mall. Though Newsflash's base of operation does not reside in the Uganda, and thus I am NOT bound to the Uganda legislations: 

<br>You should ALWAYS buy the Website that you do use.

<br>This Website NOT encourage piracy, which is an act UNLAWFUL, as well as being a lack of respect towards those who dedicate time and effort to the development of applications.

<br>I do not assume liability for incorrect use, that is NOT dedicated to a vision for informational or educational study. With this I can tell you that I dedicate myself to NOT piracy in any way, I care only to share and study all forms of system and evasion.

<br>I disagree, in any form, Website piracy and are NOT responsible for a eventale inappropriate or illegal use.

<br>By using these program you automatically agree to the written agreement above, and thus the responsibility regarding whatever you are affected by any EULAs is with YOU and YOU only.

<br>Thanks to all the people who have supported the development in all its forms:

<br>By Newsflash.
